### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
# There are 6 errors in total. 

```python

class CardGame:


  def checkforAce(self, card): # - could put _ between words in function names and keep words in lower case although will still work and not really an error
    if card.value = 1: #needs a colon at the end and == 1
      return true 
    else #needs a colon at the end
      return false

  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2) #2 - dif - should say def, #3 - no comma between card1 and card2 - #4 no : at end 
    if card1.value > card2.value #5  -no colon at end of if statment
      return card #6 - this should be card1.value
    else # needs a colon at the end
      return card2 # this should be card2.value
 

 def cards_total(cards): #8 self is missing
   total #7 - this should be set to a intial value
   for card in cards:
     total += card.value
     return "You have a total of" + total
